 # Hello! We hope you’ve been enjoying the session so far. Now it’s time to try out *augmented reality* yourself!
 
 
 We’re going to help you create a quick and simple interactive postcard to send to your friends and family. Our goal is to help you understand the meaning of [augmented reality](glossary://ar) with some hands on experience, and inspire you even more.
 
 
 
 * callout(Task):
 Before we go further you should have a drawing you will want to include. If not, just open up **[ ProCreate](glossary://procreate)** and draw whatever you want.
 
 
 When you’ve finished your masterpiece, just export it to your iPad, we’ll be using it later.
 
 ![Exporting from ProCreate](procreate_tutorial.mov)
 
 * callout(Tip):
 Remember, if you want it to be transparent, ‘.png’ is best.

 In the next steps we’ll start writing a few lines of code.
 When you think you are finished, you can go to the **[next page](@next)**.
