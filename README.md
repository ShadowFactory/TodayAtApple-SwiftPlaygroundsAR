# TodayAtApple
## SwiftPlaygrounds AR Book

Participation segment on TodayAtApple "Exclusive: Designing Augmented Realities with Shadow Factory"


---

The team at Shadow Factory was recently invited to talk at Apple's ongoing TodayAtApple event, where we were given the opportunity to talk about our experiences and challenges developing for AR.

The presentation followed with a short introductory class to programming in Swift, using Swift Playgrounds to structure the course.

We invited participants to create a drawing in ProCreate (5-10 minutes), before through a series of short introductory session on programming to place their drawing within an AR experience.
